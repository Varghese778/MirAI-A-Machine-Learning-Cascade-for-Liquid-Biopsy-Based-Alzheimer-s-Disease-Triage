## 📖 Project Overview

**MirAI** is an early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening tool built on longitudinal real-world data from the **Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**. It implements a clinically-motivated **3-stage risk escalation cascade** that progressively introduces more complex and costly biomarker data only when necessary — mirroring how a real clinical triage workflow would operate.

The system is designed as a **pre-diagnostic triage tool** to assist clinicians in identifying individuals at elevated risk of Alzheimer's Disease *before* expensive or invasive diagnostics such as PET imaging or lumbar puncture (CSF tap). It prioritizes:

- **Non-invasiveness** — Stage 3 relies solely on plasma (blood-based) biomarkers.
- **Scientific honesty** — Clinical diagnostic scores (MMSE, CDR) are strictly excluded from features to prevent target leakage.
- **Statistical rigor** — Patient-level isolation, cross-validation consistency, confidence intervals, and paired bootstrap testing.
- **Biological interpretability** — SHAP-based explainability cross-validated across folds.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** MirAI is a **research prototype** intended for academic and investigational use only. It is **not** a certified medical device and must not be used for clinical diagnosis without appropriate regulatory review.

## ✨ Key Features & Methodology

### The 3-Stage Clinical Cascade

MirAI escalates patient evaluation progressively, spending minimal resources on low-risk individuals and reserving intensive biomarker analysis for high-risk cases.

```
Patient enters pipeline
        │
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 1: Demographic Screen │  ← Age, Gender, Education (low cost)
│  AUC ≈ 0.67                 │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │ High-risk patients escalated
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 2: Genetic Augment   │  ← + APOE4 genotype
│  AUC improvement: signif.   │
└──────────────┬──────────────┘
               │ High-risk patients escalated
               ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  STAGE 3: Plasma Biomarkers │  ← + Plasma liquid biopsy panel
│  ΔAUC ≈ +0.105 (p < 0.001) │    (pT217, NfL, GFAP, Aβ ratios)
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Feature Sets per Stage

| Stage | Features | Clinical Rationale |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Stage 1** | `AGE`, `PTGENDER`, `PTEDUCAT` | Zero-cost demographic screen; available for all patients |
| **Stage 2** | Stage 1 + `APOE4` | Adds genetic risk factor; one-time genotyping |
| **Stage 3** | Stage 2 + `AB42_F`, `AB40_F`, `AB42_AB40_F`, `pT217_AB42_F`, `NfL_Q`, `GFAP_Q` | Plasma amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration panel; non-invasive liquid biopsy |

### Model Architecture

- **Algorithm:** [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) (`XGBClassifier`) — gradient-boosted decision trees with native NaN handling
- **Calibration:** Isotonic regression calibration (`CalibratedClassifierCV`) applied to Stages 2 & 3 to produce reliable probability estimates
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** `GridSearchCV` using explicitly pre-computed `StratifiedGroupKFold` splits for leakage-free cross-validation
- **Stacking:** Out-of-Fold (OOF) predictions from each stage are passed forward as an input feature to the next stage via `cross_val_predict`

### Methodological Rigor

#### 🔒 Leakage Prevention
- **Patient-level isolation:** `GroupShuffleSplit` by `RID` (ADNI patient ID) ensures zero patient crossover between train and test sets — critical for repeated-measures clinical data.
- **Consistent CV folds:** `StratifiedGroupKFold` splits are precomputed and shared identically across `GridSearchCV`, `cross_val_predict`, and `CalibratedClassifierCV`.
- **Clinical target purging:** Diagnostic cognitive tools (MMSE, CDR, ADAS-Cog, FAQ, ECog) are **strictly excluded** from all feature sets to prevent label leakage.
- **Modality integrity:** CSF biomarkers (Aβ, Tau, pTau via lumbar puncture) are excluded from Stage 3; only plasma markers are used.

#### 📊 Missing Data Strategy (MNAR)
Plasma biomarker missingness is **Missing Not At Random (MNAR)** — not all patients receive blood tests, and the absence of a test itself carries clinical meaning. Therefore:
- Aggressive imputation is avoided for plasma markers.
- XGBoost's **native NaN handling** is leveraged.
- Explicit **binary missingness indicator columns** (`_missing` suffix) are added for each plasma feature.
- SHAP analysis confirmed near-zero importance for missing indicators, validating the approach.

#### 📈 Statistical Validation
- **Bootstrapped 95% CIs** computed for all AUC scores.
- **Paired bootstrap hypothesis testing** (n=2,000 iterations) tests ΔAUC between stages:
  - Stage 3 vs Stage 2: ΔAUC ≈ **+0.105**, *p* < 0.001
- **Calibration metrics:** Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE) computed; reliability diagrams plotted. Stage 3 ECE ≈ 0.12.
- **Decision Curve Analysis (DCA):** Stage 3 demonstrates highest net clinical benefit across all clinically relevant decision thresholds.

#### 🔍 Explainability (SHAP)
SHAP values are computed **inside each CV fold** using fold-trained models and aggregated across all folds to prevent explanation bias. Top features by mean |SHAP|:

| Rank | Feature | Biological Meaning |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | `pT217_AB42_F` | Phospho-tau 217 / Aβ42 plasma ratio — strongest AD pathology signal |
| 2 | `PTGENDER` | Biological sex — women have ~2× higher lifetime AD risk |
| 3 | `NfL_Q` | Neurofilament Light — neurodegeneration marker |
| 4 | `AB42_AB40_F` | Amyloid 42/40 ratio — amyloid burden indicator |
| 5 | `AGE` | Primary demographic risk factor |

This ranking aligns precisely with established AD neuropathological mechanisms, confirming biological plausibility rather than statistical artifact.

## 🔮 Running Inference

Use the included `inference.py` to run predictions on individual patients without re-running the notebook:

```python
from inference import MirAI

model = MirAI(model_dir="models")

patient = {
    "AGE": 74,
    "PTGENDER": "Female",
    "PTEDUCAT": 16,
    "APOE4": 1,
    "AB42_F": 892.4,
    "AB40_F": 14200.0,
    "AB42_AB40_F": 0.0628,
    "pT217_AB42_F": 0.312,
    "NfL_Q": 18.7,
    "GFAP_Q": 245.0
}

# Run full Stage 3 evaluation
result = model.predict(patient, stage=3)
print(result)
# {'stage': 3, 'risk_probability': 0.87, 'risk_category': 'High Risk'}
```

The `stage` parameter accepts `1`, `2`, or `3` to run at any point in the cascade.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

- **Single cohort:** Trained and validated exclusively on ADNI data. External validation on independent cohorts (e.g., UK Biobank, AIBL) is required before broader claims.
- **No subgroup fairness analysis:** Performance stratified by age quartile, race/ethnicity, and sex has not yet been fully characterized.
- **Threshold optimization:** Operating thresholds have not been tuned for clinical cost trade-offs (sensitivity vs. specificity).
- **Prospective evaluation:** The model has not been tested in a prospective or real-world clinical setting.

## 🌿 Running the MirAI Web Interface

A local web interface is included in the `mirai-web-app/` subfolder. It features a **glassmorphism-styled single-page application** with a cyberpunk-inspired dark UI, floating particle effects, and a multi-step clinical screening wizard that runs the MirAI model cascade in your browser — no Jupyter required.

**Interface Sections:**
- **Hero** — MirAI branding, AUC performance stats, and a "Begin Screening" call-to-action
- **The 3-Stage Cascade** — Visual cards explaining Demographics → Genetics → Plasma stages
- **Clinical Dashboard** — Hexagonal metric cards showing key statistics
- **How it Works** — Interactive timeline walking through the clinical workflow
- **Patient Screening** — Multi-step wizard with toggleable data sections and form validation
- **Results** — Risk gauge chart (Chart.js), classification badge, and compassionate clinical messaging
- **Emergency Resources Panel** — Auto-shown for high-risk results; includes helpline numbers, doctor links, and clinical trial referrals
- **ASI:One AI Chatbot** — Context-aware Q&A widget powered by the ASI:One API (`asi1-mini` model); helps patients and clinicians understand screening results

        ├── mirai-stage-01.jpg
        ├── mirai-stage-02.jpg
        └── mirai-stage-03.jpg
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have already run the notebook (`MirAI_modelling.ipynb`) at least once so that the trained model files exist in `models/`:

```
models/
├── mirai_stage1_model.joblib
├── mirai_stage2_model.joblib
├── mirai_stage3_model.joblib
└── mirai_features.json
```

### Step 1 — Install the Backend Dependencies

Activate your virtual environment first (the same one used for the notebook, or any environment with Python 3.10+):

```bash
# Windows
med\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source med/bin/activate
```

Then install the web app dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r mirai-web-app/requirements.txt
```

### Step 2 — Configure the ASI:One API Key

The chatbot requires an **ASI:One** API key. Create (or edit) the file `mirai-web-app/.env`:

```env
ASI_ONE_API_KEY=your-asi-one-api-key-here
```

> Get a key at [asi1.ai](https://asi1.ai). The chatbot will still work in degraded mode (error message) if the key is missing.

### Step 3 — Start the Local Server

From the **project root** (`MirAI 2/`), run:

```bash
python mirai-web-app/app.py
```

You should see:

```
[*] Loading MirAI models ...
[+] Models loaded successfully.

[*] MirAI Web Interface is now running.
    Open your browser at:  http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 4 — Open the Interface

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

You will be greeted by the MirAI glassmorphism interface. Scroll through the landing page to explore the cascade explanation, dashboard metrics, and clinical workflow timeline. Then navigate to the **Patient Screening** section and work through the 3 wizard steps:

1. **Demographics** — Age, biological sex, and years of education.
2. **Genetics** — APOE4 allele count (toggle off if unavailable).
3. **Plasma Biomarkers** — pTau-217/AB42, NfL, GFAP values (toggle off if unavailable).

Click **Run Inference Analysis** and the interface will call the `/predict` endpoint, display a loading animation, then reveal a full **Analysis Report** with a Chart.js risk gauge, classification, compassionate clinical messaging, and recommended next steps.

If the result is **High Risk (≥60%)**, an **Emergency Resources Panel** will automatically appear with helpline numbers, doctor referral links, and clinical trial information.

A floating **AI chatbot button** (bottom-right) lets users ask follow-up questions about their results — powered by the ASI:One `asi1-mini` model.

### Step 5 — Stop the Server

Press **`Ctrl + C`** in the terminal to stop the Flask server.

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** The web interface is a local research tool. Never expose it to the public internet without proper authentication, rate-limiting, and regulatory review. Results are **not** a clinical diagnosis.
